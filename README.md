# How it works ?

- Enter BirthDate
- Enter Lucky Number
- If you click on 'clear' button, it clears both inputs, clears output and sends a confirmation alert of 'Cleared'.
- If you click 'check' button without both inputs, a alert for filling inputs is shown.
- If you click on 'Check' button with inputs, the output is seen below, and confirmation is done with a alert message "Done âœ…".

  - ### You can now see a "All Lucky Nums" button.

    - If you click "check" now, again calculation is done with output. The 'All Lucky Nums' button will not be removed.

    - If you click 'clear' button now, 'All Lucky Nums' button is removed with inputs & output cleared and a confirmation alert is seen.

    - If you click 'All lucky nums' button, irrespective of the output, a confirmation alert can be seen showing all the lucky numbers for that birthdate.

  - ### If you click on any inputs with "All lucky Nums" button present on the screen, I take it as the user is changing inputs so "All lucky Nums" button gets removed.
